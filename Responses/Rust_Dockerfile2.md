Response: 
Sure, I will provide you a simple Rust application and a Dockerfile to run it.

1. Create the Rust app, let's call it "hello.rs" with the following content:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello Docker!");
}
```

2. Create a Dockerfile in the same directory with the following content:

```Dockerfile
# Start from the latest Rust image
FROM rust:latest

# Set the current working directory inside the Docker image
WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp

# Copy the local directory contents into the Docker image
COPY . .

# Build the Rust app
RUN rustc hello.rs

# Command to run the binary
CMD ["./hello"]
```

3. Now, you can build your Docker image using:

```bash
docker build -t my-rust-app .
```

4. And run it:

```bash
docker run -it --rm my-rust-app
```

You should see "Hello Docker!" printed to the console.

Please note that the Dockerfile provided uses the latest Rust image for the build. This includes the entire Rust toolchain which is fine for a quick and simple example but is probably overkill for most practical applications. You'd likely want to use a multi-stage build for a real application to build with the Rust toolchain but then run with a much smaller runtime image.
